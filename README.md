## REPORT
### The problem definition:
A machine tool in a manufacturing shop is turning out parts at the rate of every 5 minutes. As they are finished, the parts are sent to an inspector who takes 6±4 minutes (uniform distribution) to examine each one and rejects about 10% of the parts as faulty. You are asked to run the simulation for 100 faulty parts to leave the system. Gather the statistics about average and maximum queue lengths.

#### Example Output
```
---------- REPORT ----------
Simulation Time: 4398
Average FEL Length: 1
Maximum FEL Length: 2
Max Waiting Time: 331
Average Inspection Queue Length: 33
Maximum Inspection Queue Length: 67
